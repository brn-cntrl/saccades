# saccades
Saccades is a media art / audiovisual display of protein data retrieved from the [protein data bank](https://www.rcsb.org/).
It is built in Openframeworks with a little vanilla C++ in the mix. Saccades communicates to a Pure Data patch over the network using the OSC protocol.
The Pure Data patch will be uploaded soon.
